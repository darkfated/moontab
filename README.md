# MoonTab
TAB menu made for DarkRP on Mantle library. The menu has many functions and a choice of player display style

‚ö†Ô∏è The modern version of the repository also requires downloading [GameProfile](https://github.com/darkfated/gameprofile). If you only want to use tab, [download the older version](https://github.com/darkfated/moontab/releases/tag/old-no-gameprofile)

üîß [Mantle](https://github.com/darkfated/mantle): the tab is written in this library, it will not work without it
